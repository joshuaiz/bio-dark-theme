# studio.bio Bio Dark Theme

A dark theme for VS Code inspired by Oceanic Next and Solarized Dark. Optimized for JavaScript (React), PHP, HTML, and Sass/SCSS. 

More emphasis on blues rather than greens as in Oceanic Next and Solarized. Colors are optimized for uniqueness, contrast, and comprehension and extra emphasis was placed on distinguishing features on a per-syntax basis to help with development.
