# Bio Dark theme by [studio.bio](https://studio.bio)

### ðŸŒšðŸŒ‘ðŸŒ™

A dark theme for VS Code inspired by Oceanic Next and Solarized Dark. Optimized for JavaScript (React), PHP, HTML, and Sass/SCSS. 

More emphasis on blues rather than greens as in Oceanic Next and Solarized. Colors are optimized for uniqueness, contrast, and comprehension. Extra attention was given to accentuate distinguishing features on a per-syntax basis to help with development.

###  ðŸ—’ Notes:
- VSCode version 1.4.3 (February 2020) really borks up syntax highlighting using Bio Dark. I'm working on a fix but until then I recommend not updating VSCode yet if you rely on this theme.

- The code in the screenshots (except for React) is from our WordPress starter theme [Plate](https://github.com/joshuaiz/plate).

- The typeface in the screenshots is SF Mono at 13px.

- Not all languages were tested so if you have suggestions for a language that doesn't look quite right, I encourage you to submit a pull request here: https://github.com/joshuaiz/bio-dark-theme.

- Special thanks to Sarah Drasner for her excellent article on [creating a VS Code theme](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/), Ahmad Awais for help, [Oceanic Next](https://github.com/voronianski/oceanic-next-color-scheme), and Ethan Schoonover and the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) project.

###  We hope you make something cool with this theme!
